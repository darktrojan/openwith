This document will help you to create a useful bug report (GitHub calls them *issues*), that will improve the chances of your problem being resolved quickly.

Please remember that the developer of Open With is a human, with limited time and bills to pay.

What to put in your bug report
------------------------------
* Did the problem start happening recently (e.g. after updating to a new version of Open With/Firefox) or was this always a problem?
* Which version of Open With are you using? You can get the exact version from the Firefox Add-On Manager.
* What's the name and version of the operating system you're using? What version of Firefox are you using? You can find this information by visiting `about:support` or clicking on Troubleshooting Information on the Help menu.
* Can you reliably reproduce the issue? If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.
* Open With can log information to the Browser Console. Turn it on from `about:openwith` or set the pref `extensions.openwith.log.enabled` to true. Post any information that you think might be related.
* Do you have another extension or theme installed that might cause the issue? Try disabling these other add-ons and see if the issue goes away.

What to expect
--------------
You might be asked a number of questions to help track down bugs. The developer might add a number of labels or other comments to your issue. If a solution is found and your bug gets fixed, you may have to wait a while before the fix is released. Releases *usually* happen about once a month. If a release contains a fix for your bug, the issue will be closed automatically or by the developer.

If you find a solution that doesn't require anything to be fixed, make a comment in your issue saying what you learned, and if you're confident that nothing else needs to happen, close the issue.
